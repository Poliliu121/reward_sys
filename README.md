## How to run?

Here are my env:

- JDK:

![JDK](G:\master_courses\Projects\reward_sys\img\JDK.PNG)

- Maven:

![Maven](G:\master_courses\Projects\reward_sys\img\Maven.PNG)

After you download or clone from git, go to the path where pom.xml is(it should be: ``` */proj/reward_sys```), and run ```mvn spring-boot:run``` in cmd terminal. 



## How to test?

For the credit calculator part, you can just try it on the page.

For the transaction part, I suggest you can try to modify test data in ```src/main/resources/data.json```  



## How it looks like?

At the beginning, please allowed me to say a big sorry!!

I am not good at UI part, so the front end page looks really simple:
